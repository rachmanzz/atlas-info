## Phase Objective (Pre-execution, Ready-to-go)

Reducing risk (cautious owner approach) by validating demand + locking in locations & suppliers before major renovations.

## Key Actions

* **Determine a capital-efficient operating model:** Choose a **micro coffee bar (12–20 seats)** + focus on take-away/delivery; prepare a **2-week pop-up** option in campus/office areas.
* **Fast location research (3 days):** Map 15 spots (campuses, offices, tourism routes) in **Mataram**; record **monthly rent, parking, motorcycle access, visibility, and peak hours**.
* **Low-risk location negotiation:** Seek **6–12 month contracts** + low down payment; options: **revenue sharing** with shophouses/guesthouses/souvenir shops.
* **Build Core Menu (MVP):** 6 drinks (2 espresso-based, 2 manual brew, 2 Mataram local signatures) + 4 local snacks (**consignment** basis).
* **Find local coffee suppliers:** Shortlist 3 roasters/collectors in **Lombok/Sumbawa**; request samples + price/kg; agree on consignment or 14-day payment terms if possible.
* **Calculate unit economics:** Target beverage COGS **≤30%**; set 2-tier pricing (students vs. tourists) without sacrificing margins.
* **Design "Local Wisdom" interior on a budget:** Use **anyaman/tenun** (weaving), wood, and local coffee storytelling photos; priority: workspace comfort (Wi-Fi, power outlets).
* **Prepare initial SOPs:** Brewing recipes (grammage), bar flow, cleanliness, service, and complaint handling.

## Opportunity Gaps

* Many competitors emphasize **WFC/comfort**, but there is a gap for strong **Mataram local coffee storytelling & experience** (menu + interior + storytelling).
* Gap for **affordable prices for students** with specialty quality (bundling packages & small sizes).
* Gap for **local coffee souvenir products** (drip bags/100–200g beans) for tourists.

## KPIs with Numeric Targets

* 15 location candidates surveyed, **min. 5** shortlisted with rent estimates.
* **3 coffee suppliers** tested; select 1 primary + 1 backup.
* Final MVP Menu: **6 drinks + 4 snacks** with beverage food cost **≤30%**.
* Simple BEP projection: Achieve **≥50 transactions/day** with AOV (average order value) of **IDR 20–25k**.

## Market/Competitor Insights

* Strong competitors in the WFC & comfort segment: **Konyu Coffee & Space** (4.5/475) and **LOCUS Coffee and Workspace** (4.6/303) position themselves for work/discussion.
* Strong pastry products & excellent service: **Kafebono** (4.9/1100) and **Kinta Coffee** (4.5/803) are frequently praised for coffee + pastries.
* Roastery angle: **TUWA KAWA** (4.6/271) has coffee credibility; specific food items are noted as interesting.

## AI Recommendations

* Use AI spreadsheets for **pricing & margin simulation** (price, COGS, cup cost, delivery platform taxes) and optimum price recommendations.
* Use AI to create a **location scorecard** (weighted by: rent, traffic, parking, competitors within 1km, peak hours).
* Use AI to draft a **1-page barista SOP** + opening/closing checklists.

## 0–30 Days Focus

Validate demand + lock location + prepare for soft opening with minimal setup and fast ROI.

## Weekly Sprint Breakdown (0–30 days)

### Week 1

* Finalize concept: **brand name, 1-sentence positioning, visual tone** (modern + local).
* Survey 15 locations + photos/videos of each; calculate traffic estimates (morning/afternoon/night).
* Contact 10 shophouse/space owners for **short-term lease/revenue sharing** options.
* Test coffee samples from 3 suppliers; select a consistent flavor profile.
* Draft MVP menu + calculate COGS per item.

### Week 2

* Lock location (LOI/DP) with terms: **6–12 month contract, low DP, clear permits**.
* Purchase/inspect essential budget equipment: grinder, espresso machine (lease/second-hand options), scales, kettle, filters, small fridge.
* Internet setup: Target **≥50 Mbps**, 6–10 power outlets (safe extensions).
* Recruit 1 barista (part-time/shift) + training on recipe grammage.
* Create Google Business Profile, Instagram, and TikTok accounts; take photos of the MVP menu.

### Week 3

* Light renovation: paint, warm lighting, minimal seating, local elements (**tenun/anyaman**) + Mataram coffee storyboards.
* 3-day operational trial (friends & family): measure serving time & taste.
* Prepare take-away packaging + brand stickers.
* Setup simple POS (tablet/phone) + daily stock recording.
* Deal with local snacks: consignment with 2 SMEs (clear margins).

### Week 4

* **Soft opening (7 days)**: Limited promos (not deep discounts), such as student bundling.
* Launch initial loyalty program: stamp cards (buy 7 get 1 free) or weekly subscriptions.
* Micro-collaboration: 2 campus/young professional communities (discussions/mini events).
* Activate delivery (GoFood/GrabFood) with 6 best-seller items.
* Daily review: sales, complaints, stock, peak hours; menu iteration.

## Opportunity Gaps

* Create **budget WFC packages** (coffee + local snack) as dominant competitors in WFC might not offer aggressive student packages.
* Consistent “local signature”: Drinks with local ingredients (e.g., local palm sugar/ginger/coconut) that are easy to produce quickly.
* Tourist option: **Drip bags/100g beans** as quick souvenirs.

## KPIs with Numeric Targets

* Location locked by **Day 14** at the latest.
* Soft opening: **35–50 transactions/day** by Week 4.
* AOV: **IDR 20–25k**.
* Google Rating: **≥4.6** with **≥30 reviews** within 30 days.
* Serving time: **espresso-based ≤4 mins**, manual brew **≤6 mins**.
* Target gross margin: **≥60–65%** (supporting 30–40% profit target after expenses).

## Market/Competitor Insights

* Since **Kafebono (4.9/1100)** and **Kinta (4.5/803)** are strong in pastries, focus snacks on **unique local treats** (avoid a pastry war).
* Since **Konyu** and **LOCUS** are strong for work/meetings, ensure differentiation: **local vibe + Mataram signature coffee** + budget student packages.

## AI Recommendations

* Use AI to create a **30-day content calendar** (Reels/TikTok) featuring: brewing process, coffee origin stories, local interior before-after.
* Use AI for daily sales analysis from POS: recommend **menu trimming** and optimal operating hours.
* Use AI templates to reply to Google reviews/IG DMs quickly with the brand voice.

## 31–60 Days Focus

Stabilize operations, increase repeat orders, and strengthen local coffee differentiation without major cost increases.

## Execution Blocks (Bi-Weekly)

### Days 31–45

* Optimize operating hours based on first-week data (e.g., focus on late afternoon/evening if traffic is high).
* Recipe standardization & training: 2 internal cupping sessions/week for consistency.
* Launch **Loyalty v2**: Digital points (Google Form/WhatsApp) + signature drink rewards.
* Create 2 seasonal **local signature** variants (local ingredients) that are easy to execute.
* Add souvenir SKUs: **Drip bags** + 200g beans with origin story labels.

### Days 46–60

* Community activation: 4 mini-events/month (acoustic sets, campus discussions, brewing workshops) with limited capacity.
* Light B2B cooperation: Supply coffee menus for 2 offices/guesthouses (daily cold brew thermoses/gallons).
* Enhance WFC experience: Add 2 workstations + a “quiet corner” rule (no major renovation).
* Cost audit: Renegotiate supplier rates for cups/milk; reduce waste (target milk waste <3%).

## Opportunity Gaps

* Student & young professional communities need **routine activities** (not just a place) → recurring mini-events.
* Tourists need **practical products** to take home → drip bags/beans with Mataram storytelling.
* Many coffee shops focus on "comfort," but there is a gap in **consistent taste + light local coffee education**.

## KPIs with Numeric Targets

* Average visitors: **50–70 transactions/day** achieved for at least **10 days** in the 31–60 period.
* Monthly revenue run-rate: **IDR 25–30 million**.
* Repeat customers: **≥25%** of transactions from returning customers.
* Souvenir product sales: **≥60 packs/month** (drip bags/beans).
* Google reviews: Total **≥80 reviews** with a rating of **≥4.6**.

## Market/Competitor Insights

* Competing with the service/pastry strength of **Kafebono** is inefficient for limited capital; it is more effective to highlight **Mataram signature coffee + traditional interior**.
* Workspace competitors like **LOCUS** set high comfort standards; meet minimum requirements (fast Wi-Fi, outlets) then differentiate through local experience.

## AI Recommendations

* Use AI for **stock forecasting** (beans, milk, cups) based on the last 14 days of sales to secure cash flow.
* Use AI to create **30-second education scripts** for baristas (local coffee stories) for consistency in every interaction.
* Run AI-assisted ad copy for a 3–5 km radius (small budget) with A/B tests for 2 messages: “Mataram Local Coffee” vs. “Budget WFC Package.”

## 61–90 Days Focus

Scale revenue through additional channels (delivery, B2B, tourists) and strengthen the brand as a modern coffee shop with a local touch.

## Execution Blocks (Monthly)

### Days 61–75

* Improve layout for throughput: Tidy bar station, pre-batching for certain signatures.
* Add 1 light meal item (optional) only if the kitchen allows (e.g., fried rice/toast) based on demand; no more than 1–2 items.
* Create a **subscription** package (weekly/monthly) for young professionals: 10 cups/month special price, redeemable via WhatsApp.
* Tourism partnership: 3-way cooperation (tour guides, homestays, souvenir shops) for drip bag/bean sales commissions.

### Days 76–90

* Evaluate location & capacity: If the location is less strategic, plan a **supplementary booth** (weekend pop-up) instead of a full move (low risk).
* Create an SOP for recruiting a second part-timer for peak hours.
* 90-day financial audit: Simple P&L, cash flow, most profitable items, peak hours.
* Plan for the next 90 days: Add seasonal local variants & routine community programs.

## Opportunity Gaps

* B2B channels (offices/guesthouses) are often untapped by coffee shops focusing on dine-in.
* Tourists look for “something unique” → souvenir packages + Mataram stories can be a strong differentiator.

## KPIs with Numeric Targets

* Stable at **60–80 transactions/day** (14-day average).
* Monthly revenue: **IDR 30–40 million**.
* Net profit: **≥30%** (on target) through COGS, rent, and labor control.
* Delivery share: **≥20%** of total transactions.
* B2B: **≥3 active clients** (offices/guesthouses) with a total of **≥40 cups/week**.

## Market/Competitor Insights

* With high-rated competitors (e.g., **Kafebono 4.9/1100**), social proof is vital: increase review volume and service consistency to gain market trust.

## AI Recommendations

* Use AI for a **weekly dashboard**: Transactions, AOV, COGS, peak hours, repeat rate, review sentiment.
* Use AI for competitor review analysis (Google) to find complaint/praise keywords to emulate or avoid.
* Automate WhatsApp: Quick replies for subscriptions, table reservations, and complaints.

## Executed Positioning (Not just a slogan)

**“A modern coffee shop in Mataram highlighting local coffee & traditional vibes—comfortable for work, hangouts, and souvenirs.”**

## Key Actions

* Create 3 communication pillars in-store & online:
* **Mataram Signature Coffee** (bean origin, flavor profile, brewing method)
* **Modern Comfort for WFC** (Wi-Fi, outlets, workstations)
* **Local Vibe in Interior & Snacks** (**tenun/anyaman** elements + local treats)


* Apply on-site:
* Menu board with **“Local Signature”** labels.
* “Mataram Coffee Story” photo corner (1 spot, low cost).
* Student packages (specific hours) for affordability.


* Apply on product:
* 2 signature drinks that are hard to replicate (local ingredients + clear recipes).
* Drip bag/bean products for tourists.



## Opportunity Gaps

* Competitors emphasize “WFC comfort,” but lack a **strong local narrative** and **local coffee souvenir products**.
* Pricing gap: Student packages for specialty coffee that remains delicious.

## KPIs with Numeric Targets

* 2 “Local Signature” menus contribute **≥25%** of beverage sales by Day 60.
* 1 photo spot generates **≥40 UGC content items** (tags/mentions) within 60 days.
* Student packages sell **≥15 sets/day** during target hours.

## Market/Competitor Insights

* **Konyu** & **LOCUS** are already strong as work/discussion spots → do not go head-to-head on "workspace," but add local differentiation.
* **Kafebono** & **Kinta** are strong in pastries → avoid a pastry variety war; focus on local snacks & local coffee.
* **TUWA KAWA** has roastery credibility → strengthen your own credibility through origin storytelling & mini-cuppings.

## AI Recommendations

* Use AI to formulate 10 positioning copy variations for signage/menus and test which increases AOV most.
* Use AI to create coffee origin “story cards” (1 paragraph) for consistent IG captions, menus, and packaging labels.
